        <h1>Hey, I am Kabith Kuber</h1>
        <p class="lead">I’m Kabith, a high school sophomore in Brampton, ON, and I’ve been playing the piano a versatile,
            dynamic, and beautiful instrument for over 9 years now. My journey has been a wonderful ride so far, and
            through this website, I’d like to share snippets and educate people about the love for the piano with you!
            The Radiant Piano Method was my guiding light on my piano journey. Its instruction depends on the
            approach, allowing students to be fully immersed in music. They listen and learn the flow of the piece until
            they know and feel it by heart, or at least long enough to get a good sense of the music. Only then does the
            student attempt to reproduce it. Playing by listening first is an incredibly effective way to learn music,
            because it expedites the process. Understanding how a piece of music should sound when played skillfully
            helps the student learn both hands and put them together much more quickly, find and correct mistakes, and
            thus, recreate it faster. Unlike other traditional methods, parents are highly involved. By choosing the
            Radiant Piano Method, they commit to it themselves by watching these videos, reinforcing lesson teachings
            at home,helping provide corrections, and giving positive encouragement and feedback. </p>
